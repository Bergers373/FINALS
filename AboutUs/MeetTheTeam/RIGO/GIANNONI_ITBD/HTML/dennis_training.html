	<p> Dennis was born a year after Mavis and Johnny (his parents) got married in the second film and lived with them at his grandfather's hotel.
    As he showed a lack of vampire traits, he was raised mostly human, being fed healthy foods and taught by his parents. He often played with the Werewolf kids, and he watched Kakie The Cake Monster. </p>
