<mark>Childhood Years</mark>

<p> <sup>1 </sup> Grew up with my mom and my sister here in the province of rizal.
<sup>2 </sup>My father had to work away from us so we didnt really have that much time
but during weekend we got to bond with my family together.<sup>3 </sup> My father is italian and
my mother is filipina and turns out that my mother got strong genes.<sup>4 </sup> Talking about me,
my name is Rigoletto B. Giannoni, a kid who grew up watching tv and playing toys.<sup>5 </sup> Not really
much of a "star" kinda kid.<sup>6 </sup> I was just an ordinary kid that knows nothing yet in life and
literally just being a typical kid.<sup>7 </sup> I didnt really made a lot of friends.<sup>8 </sup> Back then I was just a kid
that loves being alone.<sup>9 </sup> Just like playing PSP or Nintendo DS.<sup>10 </sup> Those what made my childhood.<sup>11 </sup> A lot of
cartoon, anime and games.<sup>12 </sup> I remember when I get along with the other kids.<sup>13 </sup> It didn't turned out bad.
<sup>14 </sup>Yeah there were times I fight with the other kids for maybe bullying me or sometimes I am just a cry
baby that wanna play with them.<sup>15 </sup> I had a great childhood too.<sup>16 </sup> Even though I was kinda wimp or what.<sup>17 </sup> I got my family
then.<sup>18 </sup> We got to go to different places like EK or star city.<sup>19 </sup> Those were my favorite places when I was a kid.<sup>20 </sup> I could say
that I had a great childhood too.<sup>21 </sup> I still did have my parents and my friends to be with at the end of the day. </p>

<h2>
<mark>Teenage Years:</mark>
</h2>
<p> <sup>1 </sup>During my teenage years i got to meet a lot people.<sup>2 </sup>Met good and bad friends.
<sup>3 </sup>This the time where i finally get into stuffs. <sup>4 </sup>Socializing with people.<sup>5 </sup> Joining
activities.<sup>6 </sup>Playing sports, i even got myself into a varsity player.<sup>7 </sup> This also
the time I experienced "puppy love".<sup>8 </sup> I was still the same guy, still an average person
but this time socializing with people now.<sup>9 </sup> This where I actually had real good friends
to bond with.<sup>10 </sup> Met a lot of people but as time passes by, you will realize not
everyone is your friend.<sup>11 </sup> You gotta have a cricle, that youu actually know that are real to
you.<sup>12 </sup> Being a teenager is fun until you know it.<sup>13 </sup> At this time, I was thought or yet thought myself
to enjoy my teenage years without abusing it and knowing where not to cross the line.<sup>14 </sup> I've been in different
places, rizal and laguna.<sup>15 </sup> Had my JHS in rizal then I got to transfered to laguna for my SHS.<sup>16 </sup> Remembering back then during my JHS,
just like what I told, I was just an average guy.<sup>17 </sup> Then when that time I got to be transferred I felt like
I was a different guy.<sup>18 </sup> That I start to have awards for my excellency during that period of time.<sup>19 </sup> I was really proud of it.
<sup>20 </sup>That I thought, I am just an average student but hey, I did that.<sup>21 </sup> That would be one of my memorable time in my teenage years.

<h2>
<mark>College Years:</mark>
</h2>
<p> <sup>1 </sup>At this stage, I entered my college very nervous.<sup>2 </sup> Im kind of province guy, not saying that 
im just a new guy in manila but it was a new atmosphere to me.<sup>3 </sup> That i had to be away in my hometown that actually made me homesick.<sup>4 </sup>
This was really new to me.<sup>5 </sup> That the fun days are near over.<sup>6 </sup> That this is no longer high school cause it's more of
"what you see is what you get".<sup>7 </sup> Studying is the number 1 priority here now and I'll be honest that i got troubles studying too.<sup>8 </sup>
That I knew bigger challenges are on the road.<sup>9 </sup> In the other hand, there was still fun.<sup>10 </sup> Just like what I've been hearing to others
to enjoy college, so I did.<sup>11 </sup> Hanging out with people I dont really know that I only knew them because they were my classmate and it turned out fine with me.
<sup>12 </sup>I thought that it wouldnt hurt at least to get to know new people.<sup>13 </sup> Yes, college is tough so I told myself i gotta get thought 
it to achieve my goals in life.<sup>14 </sup> Then it all changed, all the fun times in college was gone because of pandemic.<sup>15 </sup> From face to face class to 
online class. It has been tougher and very different.<sup>16 </sup> As much as I do I'm trying to embrace because it was really been tough for me.
<sup>17 </sup> I had troubles dealing with my studies that sometimes I felt like stopping.<sup>18 </sup> Then something hit me.
<sup>19 </sup> I should be grateful that I am still studying.<sup>20 </sup> There's a lot of people out there badly want to study too.<sup>21 </sup> I always
remind myself to always be grateful and that everything will be alright.
