    <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
    <q style="background-color:#ff9999; color:white;">Early to post 20's</q>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>During my childhood</b>,  Every youngster want to be old immediately these days.<sup>1</sup>
            But they don't know how steep and dangerous the bridge they need to get across at.<sup>2</sup>
            "I want to be old so I can do all the things I cannot do when I was a kid", that is the phrase you often hear from these children.<sup>3</sup>
            If they only knew how is it to be an adult.<sup>4</sup>
            That's the truth about man.<sup>5</sup>
            Young wants to be old, old wants to be young.<sup>6</sup>
            It's easy to say but it's very hard and exhausting, actually, to do.<sup>7</sup>
            I was a young when I realized these things.<sup>8</sup>
            Just passed the childhood test.<sup>9</sup>
            I go to middle now, which is a brilliant school, as they say.<sup>10</sup>
            I often ask myself, how would I be when I get to be an adult? Is there a manual to be an adult? Or do I just need to finish college and then voil√†! I'm an official adult already.<sup>11</sup>
            Out of curiousity, I read this book called "The Little Prince." In the first part of the book, it seems like he, the narrator, is getting my point.<sup>12</sup>
            TIt's answering my question about being an adult in some way.<sup>13</sup>
            I also tried asking some adults, but they don't have time to explain.<sup>14</sup>
            Maybe I'll just figure it out gradually, one by one, step by step, whatever you want to call it.<sup>15</sup>
            Maybe I'll just be an adult in an instant.<sup>16</sup>
			</sup></p><pre>Time flies on,
 as I grow older, <img src="josh12.jpg" alt="images" width="200" height="230" align="right">
 <strong>I look back with great nostalgia to my childhood days filled with fun and frolic.</strong><sup>17</sup> 
  All I know is I want to be a good adult.<sup>18</sup>
            No matter the circumstances are. <sup>19</sup>
            Be a good person, as they say.<sup>20</sup></i></pre>

	<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College year, seems to be exciting right?<sup>1</sup>
            experiencing being a yound adult.<sup>2</sup>
            My first year on being a college student goes well.<sup>3</sup>
            Not until the last day of first semester.<sup>4</sup>
            Every color turned into black and white.<sup>5</sup>
            I couldn't accomplish my plans so easily.<sup>6</sup>
            I stopped studying and stared working.<sup>7</sup>
            Having a huge amount of balance in school,<sup>8</sup>
            Experiencing mental breakdown and pressure.<sup>9</sup>
            Pressure of being last in your batch.<sup>10</sup>
            Pressure of not telling that i stop studying.<sup>11</sup>
            Questioning myself why i had to go through this.<sup>12</sup>
            After a year of suffering, i started studying again.<sup>13</sup>
            Having the courage to study and not to think about what happened.<sup>14</sup>
            Experiencing breakdowns in the middle of the class.<sup>15</sup>
            Still figuring out how to fight alone.<sup>16</sup>
            Controlling my emotions in the middle of the class.<sup>17</sup>
            Wanting to focus but there's a problem.<sup>18</sup>
            Keeping my heads and chins up.<sup>19</sup>
            Thinking one day, I'll get through all of this sufferings.<sup>20</sup>
