	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the many places I’d love to visit is the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. It is known as the world’s largest museum
	where the most impressive art collections in history are placed. The museum is magnificent because of its baroque-style palace-like
	structure when it was built and renovated. Jessie Szalay (2018) stated that the Louvre was originally built as a fortress during the
	1190’s but was reconstructed to serve as a royal palace during the 16th century. When it was still a royal residence, the tremendous
	growth of the said palace came into view because of every monarch who expanded it. When Louis XIV moved the royal residence to Versailles
	in 1682, the Louvre became a place to various art academies.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>How to go there?</h2>
	<br>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many travel agencies that offers a one-way flight or a two-way flight from
	Philippines to France, or vice versa.  Clients are provided with packages that give tourists the choice that best suits their preference, so that
	they are good to go. However, if the person wishes to travel alone, in order to get to the Louvre Museum, book a plane ticket going to France. The
	travel time of air transport from the Philippines to France takes for about almost 19 hours. Once the destination is reached, book a cab or any road
	transport that can send you to the Louvre Museum in Rue de Rivoli which will take for about 40 minutes. </p>
	<br>
	<h2>Other places to visit in this country</h2>
	<br>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since France have most of the historic buildings and artworks, it’s best to also visit
	the Palace of Versailles or what they call The Cháteau de Versailles which is known as the most famous castle in France. The enormous complexity of
	every buildings, gardens and terraces is definitely worth it to be seen. The exceptional accommodations, lavish decorations, furniture, and gilded works
	of Renaissance art is a must to visit. </p>
